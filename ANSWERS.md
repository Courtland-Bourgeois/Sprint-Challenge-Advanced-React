- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

  A big reason to use class components is because a lot of bigger companies that have been around awhile still have grandfathered class components in their code, so knowing how to navigate class components would be beneficial for future job searches. Also, if an app requires lifecycle methods...class components should be used.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

  Mounting: the phase where the component is being built out
	Updating: updating the component data
	Unmounting: removing the component from the screen

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

  The purpose of a custom hook is to be reused for anything from handling controlled inputs, managing event listeners, and/or watching key presses.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

  Testing minimizes the risk of bugs finding their way into production code. Testing does the following:
		* Surfaces bugs faster
		* reduces the risk of regression
		* Allows us to trust the code
		* Makes us think about the edge cases
		* Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring
		* Acts as documentation for the code
		* Encourages us to write more testable code
